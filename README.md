# Channel Auto-Post Bot

This bot can send all new messages from one channel, directly to another channel (or group, just in case), without the forwarded tag!

## Setting up 

* First:

> `APP_ID` and `API_HASH` - Get it from my.telegram.org   

> `BOT_TOKEN` - Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)   

> `FROM_CHANNEL1` - The ID of the main channel from where posts have to be copied. (Use @chnlidbot to get it.)   

> `TO_CHANNEL1` - The ID of the channel to which the posts are to be sent. (Use @chnlidbot to get it.)  

> `TO_CHANNEL2`

> `TO_CHANNEL3`

> `TO_CHANNEL4`

> `TO_CHANNEL5`
# Branch warking format ðŸ‘‡
